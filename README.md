<font color=red>Note: Not working (for me atleast)</font>
- This reinstates missing or changed artifacts from the PlayStation 2 version of the game.
- Core Pack is the one to download as it only includes fixes and no added improvements which I, Personally feel improves the original game without changing how it was originally.

- Contains fixes for many framerate related issues. 
- By limiting the game to 60 FPS and using Framerate Vigilante, it's possible to achieve good, playable gameplay.

## [Mouse Wheel Radio Changer (MWRC)](https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=22492)

## [Ped Speech Patch (GTA VC) ](https://gtaforums.com/topic/817075-ped-speech-patch-gta-vc/)
- Player and pedestrians dialogue is very rare compared to PlayStation 2 version
- An ASI plugin that will make pedestrians (including Tommy himself) more talkative, like they were on the PS2 version of the game. There's also an INI file with a setting that can make Tommy even MORE talkative.
- Supports 1.0, 1.1 and Steam.

## [Havana Outfit Fix](https://gtaforums.com/topic/893412-havana-outfit-fix/)
- After finishing Cop Land or No Escape? missions the havana outfit gets moved behind invisible wall
- It checks for the misplacement of the Havana outfit pickup and repositions it to the correct location. 
- After completing "Two Bit Hit", the Havana outfit pickup is created in a clothing shop in Little Havana. But doing "Cop Land" or "No Escape?" afterwards causes the game to misplace the pickup behind an invisible barrier.
- This can normally be avoided if those missions are completed before "Two Bit Hit" but with this mod you can complete the missions in whatever order you want without the pickup being misplaced. 

## [RunDLL32.exe Fix](https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=19293)
## [NoDEP](https://www.mixmods.com.br/2015/03/nodep-desativar-dep.html)
- Disables Data Execution Prevention (DEP) on Windows to prevent crashes in some scenarios.
